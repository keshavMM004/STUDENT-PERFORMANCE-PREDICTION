# STUDENT-PERFORMANCE-PREDICTION
In this repository we analyze various factors such as class participation , hours spent , student focus etc to predict there future performances and analyze which factors matters the most .

Project Title: Predicting Student Performance
1.	Introduction
This project explores how various factors influence student grades by applying multiple classification algorithms. The goal is to identify factors which strongly impact academic performance.
2.	Data Description
Source: CSV file containing records for students of different nationalities and grade levels
Data include:
RaisedHands – Number of times a student raised their hand
VisitedResources – Number of times a student accessed online resources
AnnouncementsView – Number of announcements viewed
Discussions – Number of discussion posts
StudentAbsenceDays – Attendance rate
StudyHours – Number of hours spent studying
3.	Methodology
Data Preprocessing
Handle missing values
Encode categorical variables
Normalize numerical features
Model Training
Split data into training and test sets
Train multiple classifiers (e.g., Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, Random Forest, SVM)
Evaluation
Compute accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score for each model
Generate confusion matrices and graphs .
4.	Results & Visualizations
Graphs:
Feature importance bar charts
ROC curves for each classifier
Confusion Matrices:
Display true vs. predicted labels to assess misclassification patterns
5.	Conclusion
By comparing model performance and inspecting feature-importance scores, we determine which factors—such as study hours or class participation—have the greatest influence on student grades.
